HANGMAN
For this project, we were asked to code the classic game of hangman, except with a small twist. The words that we were to find are encrypted, so not only did I write code to play the game, but to decrypt the words as well. The project 2 final file is where you can find the code to run the game, and the project 2 flowchart file contains both the flowchart for the game, and for the decryption. To complete this project, I first made the flowchart for decrypting the words. By following the flowchart provided, I was able to just reverse the +1 or -1 for ascii text whether "i" was odd or even. Then, it was just writing code to read the words given, selecting one of them randomly, and displaying the game to the user.
